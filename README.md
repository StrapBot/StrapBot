## Installation/Selfhosting

Please... don't. Just use the instance we host. \
If you **really** want to selfhost out bot you need to get a MongoDB connection string (or selfhost MongoDB) install and configure [DankMemer's Imgen](https://github.com/DankMemer/imgen), install and configure [Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases/latest). \
Note that we're **not** helping you to set it up on your host.
